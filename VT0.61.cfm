ValidateThis! 0.61 - Simpler Integration

<p>Just a note to announce that I've released version 0.61 of ValidateThis! on <a href="http://validatethis.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">RIAForge</a>.</p>
<p>I've made one small change, which will not affect backward compatibility.  I've changed the validate() method of the BOValidator object so it now returns a Result object. This will allow for super simple integration in use cases where more advanced integration is unnecessary.</p>
<p>I'll be discussing this simple integration method in <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/ValidateThis-and-Transfer">my series</a> about integrating VT with Transfer, which is currently underway.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or interest in following the progress of VT, I invite you to join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/validatethis" target="_blank">ValidateThis! Google Group.</p>
