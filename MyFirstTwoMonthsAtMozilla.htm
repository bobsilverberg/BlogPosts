My First Two Months With Mozilla

<p>Two days ago marked my two-month anniversary with <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>,
    and as I never officially announced the start of my employment there
    (at least not via my blog), I figured it was time to write a post about it.</p>
<p>I realize that this may be news to some readers of this blog, so I'll start with a bit of background. I have been a
    <a href="https://mozillians.org">Mozillian</a> for quite some time, actively contributing to projects primarily for the
    <a href="https://quality.mozilla.org/teams/web-qa/">Web QA</a> department, but also doing a bit for
    <a href="https://quality.mozilla.org/teams/automation/">Automation</a>. I have been heavily involved in open source development
    for several years, and the goal of providing users with more choice through open source software is one that is near and dear to my
    heart, so taking a job with Mozilla made perfect sense. I am glad to say that it has been everything that I had hoped it would be,
    and more.</p>
<p>I am now a member of the stupendous <a href="https://quality.mozilla.org/teams/web-qa/">Web QA</a> team. We are responsible for
    ensuring the quality of Mozilla's many web sites, which include <a
            href="https://www.mozilla.org">mozilla.org</a>, <a href="https://support.mozilla.org">Mozilla Support</a>,
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">Firefox Add-ons</a>, The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">Mozilla
        Developer Network</a>,
    <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com">Firefox Marketplace</a>, and many others. We have also recently been testing
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefoxos/">Firefox OS</a>, Mozilla's exciting new mobile operating system. My main
    focus is writing automated tests using Python and <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>,
    and more recently <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Marionette">Marionette</a> (for Firefox OS), but I have
    also been using Javascript quite a bit (as that is the basis for Firefox OS).</p>
<p>In addition to that I spend quite a bit of time with Jenkins, which we use for Continuous Integration, and more recently
    I helped to build an IRC bot using node.js and MongoDB. I plan to write a separate post about that in the near future.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, it's been a great experience thus far - something I can recommend to anyone. If you're interested in
    finding out what it's like to be a Mozilla contributor, and having a chance to learn new or improve upon
    existing skills in testing, Python, Selenium and/or Git, you should check us out.
    You can find me and my Web QA colleagues in <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/#mozwebqa">#mozwebqa</a> on <a
    href="http://irc.mozilla.org/">irc.mozilla.org</a>, which is really the ideal place to get started.
    We also have a <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/mozwebqa">mailing list</a> that you can join, and you can
    always find more information about who we are and what we do via our <a href="https://quality.mozilla.org/teams/web-qa/">QMO Page</a>.
    I hope to see some of you online soon!</p>
