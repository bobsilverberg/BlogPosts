ValidateThis! No Longer Relies on Coldspring

In an effort to make ValidateThis!, my validation framework for ColdFusion objects, <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2009/4/8/Stop-the-Presses--ValidateThis-Now-Easier-to-Use-Than-a-Mac">as easy as possible to integrate</a> into existing applications, I decided to remove its reliance on Coldspring.  I was just using Coldspring for internal Dependency Injection (DI), and as there aren't really that many components that make up the framework it wasn't that difficult a change to make. So now the framework is truly DI framework agnostic, as well as being <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2009/4/8/Its-Official-ValidateThis-Works-with-Reactor">Persistence Layer framework agnostic</a>.</p>
<p>I hope to release version 0.7 soon, which will include these changes, as well as the new <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2009/4/8/Stop-the-Presses--ValidateThis-Now-Easier-to-Use-Than-a-Mac">ValidateThis Service Object</a>, which allows for super-simple integration.</p>
