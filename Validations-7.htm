ValidateThis! - Object Oriented Validation Code Available at RIAForge

I have made the code for my object oriented validation framework for ColdFusion <a href="http://validatethis.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">available on RIAForge</a>.
</p>
<p>The download includes a demo application and set-up instructions.  One should be able to get the demo up and running on one's machine in fairly short order.  The set-up instructions also include some fairly detailed documentation about integrating the framework with an existing model, which I won't repeat here.  I may write some posts about it in the future, but for now, if you're interested, just download the code, take it for a spin, and take a peek under the hood.  The code base itself is actually fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>You may recall, if you've read my previous posts on the subject, that this project started out as a proof-of-concept for an object oriented approach to validations.  I'm pretty happy with the product that resulted from this exercise, but there is definitely room for improvement and enhancement.  I'm very keen to hear from anyone that checks it out and attempts to use it, and I'm willing to help anyone who runs into difficulty getting the demo up and running, or has questions about integrating the framework into an existing model.</p>
<p>Feel free to email me directly or use the google group <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/validatethis" target="_blank">(groups.google.com/group/validatethis)</a> that I set up to facilitate more of a "conversation".</p>
