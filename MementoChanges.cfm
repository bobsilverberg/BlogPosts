Transfer's getMemento() has Changed

Although I have been fairly vocal about the fact the getMemento() method available from Transfer (an ORM for ColdFusion) is undocumented and subject to change, and have even written <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2008/6/17/Using-Transfer-Metadata-to-Create-a-Memento">my own implementation of it</a> in my AbstractTransferDecorator, I discovered today that I am actually still calling it one place in my ColdFusion application code (which I wrote a long time ago).  And that one line of code is now throwing an error.  I understand from <a href="http://www.12robots.com/index.cfm/2008/8/13/Form-Handling-and-Validation-with-ColdBox-ColdSpring-and-Transfer#comments">some comments</a> on <a href="http://www.12robots.com/">Jason Dean's</a> blog that the internal implementation of mementos did change recently, in Transfer 1.1 according to <a href="http://www.compoundtheory.com/">Mark Mandel</a>, which explains my problem.</p>

I just thought it would be worth sharing this with the community, as I have a feeling that I'm not the only one to use getMemento() on occasion.  So be warned: if any of your code uses getMemento() test it with the latest BER of Transfer as you may need to make changes to your code before deploying Transfer 1.1.</p>
