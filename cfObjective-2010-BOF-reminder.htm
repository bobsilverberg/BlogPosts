Coming to cf.Objective()? What Interests You?

The folks organizing <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective()</a> are in the process of finalizing the BOF sessions and are looking for feedback from you!</p>
<p>In case you're unfamiliar with the term, BOF stands for <em>Birds of a Feather</em> and it's an informal session in which the attendees get a chance to chat about a topic  
with other developers who have similar interests. It's a great chance to get a bit more interactive - you get to participate rather than just sit and watch.</p>
<p>I suggested that during one of the BOF sessions we do a series of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha" target="_blank">Pecha Kucha</a> presentations, which are similar to 
<a href="http://ignite.oreilly.com/" target="_blank">Ignite</a> presentations, and my suggestion was graciously accepted by the committee.
I <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2009/12/18/Anyone-Can-Speak-at-cfObjective-for-around-six-minutes">blogged about this session previously</a>
and am still looking for volunteers to present, so if you're interested in that please mosey on over to 
that <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2009/12/18/Anyone-Can-Speak-at-cfObjective-for-around-six-minutes">blog post</a> and comment.</p>
<p>There are seven remaining BOF slots, and <a href="http://corfield.org/" target="_blank">Sean Corfield</a> 
has <a href="http://corfield.org/entry/cfObjective_2010__BOF_suggestions" target="_blank">blogged about</a> the other topics that have been suggested thus far.

<p>Decisions will be made in the not-too-distant future, and to help you vote on topics and make new suggestions a <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SGJ37Y7" target="_blank">survey</a> has been created.
It's a one-question survey that should take no more than about 30 seconds to complete,
so if you'll be attending cf.Objective() please take the time to <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/SGJ37Y7" target="_blank">add your opinion</a>.
</p>
<p>I hope to see many of you at cf.Objective() in April!</p>
