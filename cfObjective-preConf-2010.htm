Awesome Training Available Before cf.Objective()

As you're no doubt aware, <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective()</a>, "The World's Only Enterprise Engineering Conference for ColdFusion Developers", is
coming to Minneapolis, MN from April 22-24, 2010. It's an outstanding opportunity to learn a ton of stuff, and to network and socialize with like-minded developers. I am pleased an honoured to be
speaking, twice, for the second year in a row.
What you may not realize, however, is that in the days prior to the conference there is a boatload of training available.</p>
<h3>Developing Applications with ColdFusion 9 Object Relational Mapping</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.compoundtheory.com/" target="_blank">Mark Mandel</a> and I will be delivering a comprehensive hands-on workshop
on <a href="http://www.ColdFusionORMTraining.com">Developing Applications with ColdFusion 9 Object Relational Mapping</a> for two whole days, from
April 20-21, and it's going to be fantastic, if I do say so myself. 
If the new features of ColdFusion's ORM integration don't interest you (buy why wouldn't they?), there are five other choices.</p>
<h3>Something For Everyone</h3>
<p>Here's the full list of all of the courses available:
<ul>
	<li>Building Secure CFML Applications (April 21) - Jason Dean and Pete Freitag</li>
	<li>Coldbox:100 Training (April 21) - Luis Majano</li>
	<li>Developing Applications with ColdFusion 9 Object Relational Mapping (ORM) (April 20-21) - Bob Silverberg and Mark Mandel</li>
	<li>Getting Started with Flex and AIR Development with the Flex SDK (April 21) - John Mason</li>
	<li>Mach-II and OOP from the Ground Up (April 20-21) - Kurt Weirsma, Peter Farrell and Matt Woodward</li>
	<li>Rapid Development with Model-Glue 3 (April 20-21) - Dan Wilson and Ezra Parker</li>
</ul></p>
<p>There really is something for everyone, and the instructors are all top-notch.</p>
<h3>Anyone Can Attend</h3>
<p>Something else you might not realize; you don't have to attend cf.Objective() in order to sign up for and attend a pre-Conference training class. So, if you've been hankering to 
learn more about CF9 ORM, application security, ColdBox, Model-Glue, Mach-II, or Flex and AIR development, go for it!</p>
<h3>The Early-Bird Ends Friday</h3>
<p>I'll close with a reminder; the discounted early-bird rates, which apply to both the cf.Objective() conference fee and to most of the pre-conference training sessions, expires this Friday,
January 29th. So why not save some cash and sign up right now? Registration is done via the <a href="https://www.bestmeetings.com/registration/cfobjective/cfobjective.cfm" target="_blank">cf.Objective() registration form</a>.</p>
<p>I hope to see many of you there in April.</p>
