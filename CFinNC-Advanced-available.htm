Advanced Techniques with ColdFusion 9 ORM Integration - Slides Available

The slides, which include all of the sample code from my <a href="http://cfinnc.com/" target="_blank">CFinNC</a> presentation, <em>Advanced Techniques with ColdFusion 9 ORM Integration</em>, are now available. Click on the link below to download them. I developed these slides using Keynote, and attempted to save them as a PowerPoint presentation, but ended up with slides that looked like crap, so I saved them as a PDF for the download. The slides look good, but the file is <strong>big</strong>. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in having me deliver this presentation to a ColdFusion User Group via connect please feel free to leave me a comment, or send me an email.</p>

<p>Here is the description of the presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ColdFusion engineering team have made it very easy to make use of Hibernate's ORM features out of the box, but what if you want to do something a bit more complicated? In this session we'll cover items that will be of interest to those wanting to take CF and Hibernate to the next level. Topics will include Hibernate session management, Working with detached objects, Concurrency, Event handling, and Creating a base persistent object.</p>
