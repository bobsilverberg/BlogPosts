ValidateThis! 0.65 - Runs on Railo!

<p>Thanks to some prompting from a guy named Charlie I took some time this weekend to attempt to get ValidateThis!, my framework for ColdFusion objects, running on <a href="http://www.railo-technologies.com/en/index.cfm" target="_blank">Railo</a>.</p>
<p>Installing and configuring Railo to run on my Windows machine with Apache was a bitch, but after some help from <a href="http://www.compoundtheory.com/" target="_blank">Mark Mandel</a> I had it up and running. A few hours of debugging later, with the help of <a href="http://mxunit.org/" target="_blank">MXUnit</a>, of course, and with a bit more help from Mr. Mandel, the framework was tested and working on Railo.</p>
<p>I must say that I really like Railo.  The administrator is nice - I had no problems setting up mappings and datasources to mimic my CF install. And it seems to run markedly faster than CF, on my machine anyway.</p>
<p>I plan to write some posts on the challenges that I encountered, both with the installation and with the code base, in the near future.  As always, the code is available to download from<a href="http://validatethis.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">RIAForge</a>, and if you have any questions or interest in following the progress of VT, I invite you to join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/validatethis" target="_blank">ValidateThis! Google Group</a>.</p>
