Getting Started with VT and Transfer - Starting Over

I have made some changes to ValidateThis!, my validation framework for ColdFusion objects, which have made integration far easier, but which have also broken the previous examples in this series. So rather than walking through all of the changes required to get those old examples working, I'm just going to start from scratch.</p>
<p>So please stay tuned for a new series of posts and examples, coming soon.</p>
