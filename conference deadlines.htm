Two Important Deadlines for ColdFusion Developers

Just wanted to post a quick reminder to folks of the following dates:</p>
<h3>cf.Objective() Early-Bird Ends Sunday</h3>
<p>The discounted early-bird rates, which apply to both the <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective()</a> conference fee and to most of the pre-conference training sessions, expires this Sunday,
February 14th. You can save $100 on the conference fee and a whopping $200 off of <a href="http://www.compoundtheory.com/" target="_blank">Mark Mandel</a> 
and my two-day hands-on workshop, <a href="http://www.ColdFusionORMTraining.com">Developing Applications with ColdFusion 9 Object Relational Mapping</a> if you register before the end of Valentine's Day.
So what are you waiting for? Registration is done via the <a href="https://www.bestmeetings.com/registration/cfobjective/cfobjective.cfm" target="_blank">cf.Objective() web site</a>.</p>
<p>And if ORM isn't your thing, there are a whole bunch of workshops from which to choose, most of which are offering discounts:
<ul>
	<li>Building Secure CFML Applications (April 21) - Jason Dean and Pete Freitag</li>
	<li>Coldbox:100 Training (April 21) - Luis Majano</li>
	<li>Developing Applications with ColdFusion 9 Object Relational Mapping (ORM) (April 20-21) - Bob Silverberg and Mark Mandel</li>
	<li>Getting Started with Flex and AIR Development with the Flex SDK (April 21) - John Mason</li>
	<li>Mach-II and OOP from the Ground Up (April 20-21) - Kurt Weirsma, Peter Farrell and Matt Woodward</li>
	<li>Rapid Development with Model-Glue 3 (April 20-21) - Dan Wilson and Ezra Parker</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>Voting for CFUnited Ends Today</h3>
<p>The folks at <a href="http://cfunited.com" target="_blank">CFUnited</a> have given the ColdFusion community the opportunity to help choose which sessions
will be included by <a href="http://callforspeakers.cfconf.org/?event=vote&eventId=188" target="_blank">voting</a> on them. Unfortunately the window of
opportunity is very small, with the vote closing today, February 12th. So get out there and <a href="http://callforspeakers.cfconf.org/?event=vote&eventId=188" target="_blank">vote</a>,
and while you're there please consider voting for <a href="http://blog.mxunit.org/" target="_blank">Marc Esher</a>'s sessions. He's an awesome speaker and no slouch in the brain department, and his proposed
End-to-End Testing Roundtable will be a session not to miss.</p>
