ValidateThis ColdBox Plugin Update

Thanks to <a href="http://www.aliaspooryorik.com/blog/" target="_blank">John Whish</a>, a bug in the <a href="http://www.validatethis.org/" target="_blank">ValidateThis</a> <a href="http://www.coldboxframework.com/" target="_blank">ColdBox</a> plugin has been fixed, so a new version is available at the <a href="http://validatethiscbplugin.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">RIAForge project site</a>.</p>
<p>ValidateThis is a validation framework for ColdFusion objects that provides automatic server-side and client-side validations, plus a whole lot more. 
I have recently started using Git for version control for ValidateThis, and have moved the source code to <a href="github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
This made it extremely easy for John to create his bug fix and submit it to me for inclusion in the plugin. If anyone is interested in contributing to the project 
(either the plugin or the core), you can fork the corresponding Git repo from <a href="http://github.com/bobsilverberg" target="_blank">my GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p>John and I are working on some sample code that will demonstrate the integration between ValidateThis and ColdBox, and which will be included in the RAIForge download in the near future.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about ValidateThis, there are a number of resources available:
<ul>
	<li>I recorded a presentation for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/" target="_blank">Online ColdFusion Meetup</a>, which is <a href="http://experts.na3.acrobat.com/p40599889/" target="_blank">available here</a>.</li>
	<li>The code for the framework, including a number of sample applications is available from the Riaforge Site, <a href="http://validatethis.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">validatethis.riaforge.org</a>.</li>
	<li>A number of online demos can be viewed at <a href="http://www.validatethis.org/" target="_blank">www.validatethis.org</a>.</li>
	<li>If you have any questions at all about the framework or how to implement and use it, they can be directed to the ValidateThis! Google Group at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/validatethis" target="_blank">groups.google.com/group/validatethis</a>.</li>
