CFUnited is Almost Here - Learn about Validations and ORM

As I'm sure many of you are aware, <a href="http://cfunited.com" target="_blank">the final CFUnited</a> will be starting in a little over a week. 
Although I did attend a couple of CFUN's in the past (when they were a one-day event), this will be my first CFUnited, so I'm pretty excited
about it. It will be great to meet even more people than I usually do at other conferences, such as <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective()</a> and <a href="http://ncdevcon.com/" target="_blank">NCDevCon</a>, and I wanted
to give a final plug to my sessions, as I think they will be of interest to a lot of developers. As well, I've made some last minute changes to
both sessions to cover some new material.</p>
<h3>What Your Mother Never Told You About CF9 ORM</h3>
<p>The ColdFusion team at Adobe have done an outstanding job with ColdFusion ORM, which now provides ColdFusion developers with access to
<a href="http://www.hibernate.org/" target="_blank">Hibernate</a>, an enterprise-ready, open source, industry-standard Java ORM. The documentation on how to use CF ORM in the ColdFusion docs is also quite 
good, providing most of what you need to know to make use of the features. The problem, however, is that Hibernate is a pretty complex tool, and in
order to use CF ORM successfully you really need to understand certain things about Hibernate. This session is designed to teach you some of those 
things - it will cover material that is not included in the ColdFusion documentation, but that is essential to understand when working with the ORM.</p>
<p>Topics covered will include Hibernate Session Management, Understanding Object States, Working with Detached Objects, Concurrency and 
Using a Base Persistent Object. We'll also be looking at the new Transaction Management model in the recently released ColdFusion 9.0.1.
If you plan on working with CF ORM and are not already familiar with these concepts I think you'll really benefit from this session. It is,
however, an advanced session, so if you are totally unfamiliar with CF ORM you may find it a bit confusing.</p>
<p>The session is scheduled for 5:30pm (ouch!) on Wednesday, July 28th.</p>
<h3>Automagic Validations for ColdFusion Objects</h3>
<p>This session will provide an overview of, as well as a detailed <em>how-to</em> about a Validation framework for ColdFusion. The title is
a slight misnomer, as, although the framework was originally written to work inside an object-oriented application, and remains an ideal solution for
that, it has recently been enhanced to work with simple ColdFusion structures as well.  This means that anyone who is looking for a better way of
addressing their validation requirements, both on the client side and on the server side, can now benefit from the framework, even if they are not
using objects.</p>
<p>The main benefit of the framework is that it will automatically generate all of your client-side and server-side validations for you, from a simple
set of metadata. This frees you from the drudgery of writing similar validation code over and over again, and also eliminates the possibility of adding
bugs into your application via your validation code. The framework, called <em><a href="http://www.validatethis.org/" target="_blank">ValidateThis</a></em>, is being actively developed by myself and a number of 
other contributors, so not only is it extremely functional and flexible right now, but new features are being added continually. If you are
interested in finding out more about it, including exactly how to implement it in a new or existing application (and it's dead easy), I encourage
you to attend my session. It will be held at 3:15pm on Friday, July 30th, and is being repeated at 2:45pm on Saturday, July 31st.</p>
<p>I hope to see you at one, or both, of my sessions. If we haven't met before please come by and say hi.</p>
