OT: I Drink Your Milkshake

First off, I apologize for the OT post.  I really do try to limit these, and hopefully putting OT in the title of my post means that most uninterested people won't even be bothered by it.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the story.  I don't get much of a chance to watch movies, what with being a part-time stay at home father to two boys under the age of 4, <em>and</em> a part-time CF developer trying to keep on top of things and learn OO design and development.  I've recently started a new exercise regimen that has me riding a <a href="http://www.visionfitness.com/home/fitnessbikes/prod.php?id=10" target="_blank">stationary bike</a> in my basement for an hour every other day, and while I ride the bike I usually get a chance to watch half of a movie.  That is why I was finally able to view <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/" target="_blank">There Will be Blood</a></em> the other night.</p>
<p>Loved it, which is usually the case for me with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000759/" target="_blank">P. T. Anderson</a> movies.</p>
<p>By some strange coincidence I was up late last Saturday night, reading blog posts and not really watching what was on the TV, when a skit came on Saturday Night Live that caught my eye.  Now I'm old enough to remember when SNL was really, really funny, and also when it became really, really not funny, at which point I pretty much stopped watching.  So I really have no idea whether the current cast of SNL does a good job or not, but I had assumed the latter.  So I was amazed as I watched this skit, which I found to be one of the funniest things I've seen in years.  It was a spoof of <em>There Will Be Blood</em>, with a touch of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/" target="_blank"><em>No Country for Old Men</em></a>, and even <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/" target="_blank"><em>Juno</em></a> thrown in.  I was laughing out loud.  I laughed so much that I had to see it again, so I googled it and found a link to it.</p>
<p>So, if you've seen <em>There Will Be Blood</em>, and enjoyed it, and haven't seen the related SNL sketch, see below.  I'm pretty sure you'll be entertained.</p>
