cf.Objective() 2011 - Deliberations Have Begun

The Call for Speakers for <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective() 2011</a> has now ended and thus begins the gargantuan task of choosing which sessions to include at this year's conference.
The <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2010/11/17/cfObjective-2011--The-Wheels-are-in-Motion" target="_blank">Content Advisory Board</a> is already hard at work reviewing proposals which we'll be discussing over the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>For those that are interested, we've received 154 proposals from 69 speakers. Most every topic you can imagine is represented, and we've had a large number of proposals in some topic areas that are fairly new to cf.Objective().
For example we've had 17 proposals for JavaScript talks, 8 of which involve jQuery, and 6 of those involve jQuery Mobile. 
We've had 13 proposals for talks about Mobile development, 9 proposals for talks on REST and 4 proposals for talks about noSQL databases.</p>
<p>As mentioned above we hope to have some announcements about the sessions and speakers chosen within the next two weeks or so.</p>
