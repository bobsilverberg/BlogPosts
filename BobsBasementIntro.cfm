Vitamin Sweet with Bob and Brian to Debut on CodeBass Radio Next Friday

That's right, your heard it correctly, I will be starting my second show on CodeBass radio next week, along with my partner in crime, Brian Rinaldi. What's Vitamin Sweet all about? 
Why new releases, of course! Every other week we'll bring you an hour packed with songs that have recently been released. 
Here's your chance to keep on top of what's new and cool out there (according to Brian and me, of course). 
We'll be featuring music from both brand new bands, and bands that have been around for some time, but we promise that everything will be new, and will be hand picked by one of us.
I'll be playing tunes that I like and Brian will be doing likewise, and perhaps we'll have a few tunes that get the double-B seal of approval.</p>
<p>So, if you love music, and are keen to hear some of the newest stuff out there, join us on Friday, April 1st at <a href="http://bit.ly/hHb5ha" target="_blank">10:00am Eastern time</a>,
on <a href="http://codebass.net/codebass-radio/" target="_blank">CodeBass Radio</a> for our maiden voyage, and then tun in every other Friday at the same time.
You can listen in at <a href="http://www.codebassradio.com/" target="_blank">www.codebassradio.com</a> or by using the awesomely cool <a href="http://mediaslurp.com/" target="_blank">MediaSlurp</a> AIR app which comes bundled with a bunch of other great community streams and podcasts.</p>
<p>I hope to see you online next Friday morning.</p>
