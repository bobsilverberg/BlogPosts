ValidateThis API Documentation Available

I'm in the process of creating a roadmap for future development of ValidateThis, my validation framework for ColdFusion objects. I am discussing the roadmap with interested parties
via the new <a href="http://groups.google.ca/group/validatethis-dev" target="_blank">ValidateThis-dev</a> google group, so if you're interested in having any input, or just following
along, I welcome you to join that group.</p>
<p>One item that appears on the roadmap is improving the documentation for the framework. There is quite a lot of documentation already available on the 
<a href="http://www.validatethis.org/docs/" target="_blank">ValidateThis wiki</a> (thanks to the <a href="http://www.codexwiki.org/" target="_blank">CodexWiki</a> team for the tool), 
but I know that there are some holes.  I'm going to try to shore up the docs over the next while, but in the meantime I figured I might as well generate some JavaDoc-style
API documentation for the framework using <a href="http://www.compoundtheory.com/?action=colddoc.index" target="_blank">ColdDoc</a>, so that's what I've now done. 
You can find the API docs at <a href="http://www.validatethis.org/docs/api/" target="_blank">www.validatethis.org/docs/api/</a>. 
I'd like to thank <a href="http://www.compoundtheory.com/" target="_blank">Mark Mandel</a> for yet another 
rockin' ColdFusion open source tool (ColdDoc), which made this process oh so easy.</p>
<p>As always, the latest code is available from <a href="http://validatethis.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">the ValidateThis RIAForge site</a>,
and if you have any questions about the framework, or suggestions for enhancements, 
please send them to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/validatethis" target="_blank">ValidateThis Google Group</a>.
</p>
