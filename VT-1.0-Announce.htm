an awesome validation framework for ColdFusion. This version includes one new validation type, <em>notRegex</em>, which was contribted by
<a href="http://www.aliaspooryorik.com/" target="_blank">John Whish</a>, and a bunch of small fixes, contributed by

<p>Most of went into this release won't be noticable to the developer, or at least won't affect the way you interact with the framework. Here's a quick summary of
the changes in this release:
<ul>
	<li>Upgraded to the latest version of the jQuery Validation plugin, which replaces jquery.validate.pack.js with jquery.validate.min.js. 
		If you are loading this file yourself (as opposed to using a CDN, which the framework does by default), then you should replace that file.</li>
	<li>The default generated failure messages are now identical on the client and server, and are based on information in a resource bundle. 
		This means you can easily change the default generated failure messages if you wish, and the changes will be reflected on the client and the server.</li>
	<li>Thanks to John Whish (who I have unilaterally appointed as client-side-czar for the framework) the Javascript that is generated has been greatly improved.
		Many of the changes that John made were based on suggestions from <a href="http://blog.pengoworks.com/" target="_blank">Dan Switzer</a>.</li>
	<li>You can now store your definition files in a folder structure that mirrors a dot-based naming scheme for components.</li>
	<li>You can now instruct the framework to ignore missing properties in your objects, as opposed to throwing an exception if a property is missing.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The biggest change is the second one mentioned above: the default generated failure messages. If you are currently using the i18n capabilities of the framework 
this may affect you, so I suggest you read the <a href="http://www.validatethis.org/docs/wiki/Internationalization_with_ValidateThis.cfm" target="_blank">i18n information</a> available in the online documentation.
</p>
<p>If you've been holding off checking out the framework until it reached version 1.0 (silly people), now's the time to get cracking.
