ValidateThis 0.96.2 - Important Bug Fixes

Since the release of version 0.96 of ValidateThis, my validation framework for ColdFusion objects, there have been a few bug reports which I have tried
to be quick to address. This has resulted in the release of versions 0.96.1 and 0.96.2 of the framework. If anyone has downloaded a copy of 0.96 or
0.96.1, I advise you to grab a copy of 0.96.2 from the <a href="http://validatethis.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">RIAForge project page</a>.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that 0.96.2 will be as rock solid as most of the previous releases, and I want to thank <a href="http://www.aliaspooryorik.com/" target="_blank">John Whish</a> 
and <a href="http://www.quackfuzed.com/" target="_blank">Matt Quackenbush</a> for bringing the bugs to my attention.</p>
