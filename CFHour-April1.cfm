I'm Invading Your Airwaves Again

Yes, once again I've been interviewed for a ColdFusion podcast, and this time it's <a href="http://www.cfhour.com/" target="_blank">CFHour</a>. 
<a href="http://blog.dkferguson.com/" target="_blank">Dave</a> and <a href="http://coldfusionnotes.com/" target="_blank">Mike</a> 
allowed me to wax poetically about a wide range of topics including 
<a href="http://www.validatethis.org/" target="_blank">ValidateThis</a>, my validation framework for ColdFusion objects, 
the upcoming <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective()</a> conference 
and the <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/index.cfm/pre-conf/" target="_blank">pre-conference training</a>
that will be available,
<a href="http://www.model-glue.com/" target="_blank">Model-Glue</a>, specifically some of the new features that will be included in version 3.2,
<a href="http://mxunit.org/" target="_blank">MXUnit</a>, again talking about what's coming in version 2.0,
and Dave also tricked me into weighing in on the CFBuilder debate.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun, and I really appreciate being given the opportunity to let people know about all of this great stuff
that is available to the ColdFusion community. If you don't mind listening to my Canadian accent for close to an hour, 
I encourage you to give it a listen. It's available via iTunes, and can also be listened to or downloaded directly from the 
<a href="http://www.cfhour.com/post.cfm/show-47-the-bob-silverberg-show" target="_blank">show page</a>.</p>
