Presenting Building An Object Oriented Model to the Online ColdFusion Meetup

Just a quick note to announce that I'm going to be presenting my session from <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective()</a> to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/" target="_blank">Online ColdFusion Meetup</a> this Thursday, May 28th, at 6:00pm EDT.</p>
<p>Details can be found at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/calendar/10466208/" target="_blank">Meetup site</a>. You can <a href="http://experts.acrobat.com/cfmeetup/" target="_blank">attend the presentation via Connect</a> on Thursday. The session will be <a href="http://recordings.coldfusionmeetup.com/" target="_blank">recorded and made available</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the abstract for the presentation:</p>
<p>When making the move from a procedural to an object oriented approach one often comes across a pattern that involves using services and gateways to act as a middle man between a controller and your actual business objects.  This session will present an approach to implementing a common set of services and gateways. Through the use of abstract classes you will see how to eliminate duplicate code and how to encapsulate logic to increase the cohesiveness of your entire model.  We will start with the basics, describing what services and gateways are, and then look at building a model from the ground up.  You'll leave the session with an understanding of the components that go into building a model, as well as some of the object oriented principles that will help guide you in your design efforts.</p>
<p>This session is aimed at beginning to intermediate developers who have some experience with and knowledge of basic OO concepts and are interested in learning about some of the design considerations that go into building an OO model.</p>
<p>Hope to see some of you there.</p>
