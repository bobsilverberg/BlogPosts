Confused about OO?  Check out Ben!

I have received a bit of feedback on my recent series on Transfer (an ORM for ColdFusion) suggesting that it may be less than accessible to OO noobs.  I realize that I kind of just jumped into describing what I do, without much background about the basics, which I did for a number of reasons, but I understand that this may make my posts somewhat inaccessible to some readers, and for that I'm sorry.</p>
<p>The good news is that there is a series being written right now which provides an excellent foundation for learning the basics of OO in ColdFusion.  I know that I'm kind of late to this party, and if you're reading this chances are you're also reading <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/">Ben Nadel's blog</a>, but in case you're not, <strong>you should!</strong>  I've seen his posts on the aggreagtors and have been putting them in my "to read" pile.  I finally took some time last night, a few hours in fact, to read through all of his posts and all of the comments in the series thus far.  It is very, very good stuff.  In particular, <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1293-OOPhoto-Simple-Service-Objects-In-Place.htm">this post</a> provides the most accessible description and example of Dependency Injection that I've ever seen in the ColdFusion realm.</p>
<p>So, if you're having trouble grasping the OO concepts, read and follow Ben's series and then, by all means, come back and check out my Transfer series again and see if it makes a bit more sense.</p>
