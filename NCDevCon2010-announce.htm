CFinNC is Dead. Long Live NCDevCon!

In October of last year I had the honour of speaking at <a href="http://cfinnc.com/" target="_blank">CFinNC</a>, a ColdFusion / Flex / AIR conference organized by the <a href="http://tacfug.org/" target="_blank">Triangle Area ColdFusion User's Group</a>. 
It was an outstanding conference; well run, with informative sessions on timely topics, which is pretty amazing considering that it was absolutely free.</p>
<p>The mad geniuses behind CFinNC are throwing another conference this year, and this time it's called <a href="http://www.ncdevcon.com/" target="_blank">NCDevCon.</a> 
It will be held May 22-23, 2010 on the Centennial Campus of NC State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. 
This time around the conference is planning on covering a wide variety of web development and design topics including ColdFusion, Flex and AIR, Javascript and CSS, and,
just like last year, it's free as in beer.</p>
<p><a href="http://ncdevcon2010.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">Registration</a> is already open, as is a <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDl0dm1xWmRTRlZBdEVNTjhUVEl5Qmc6MA" target="_blank">Call For Presentations</a>.
I'm hoping to get a chance to speak again this year, but even if I don't I'll be there to partake in the learning and festivities. 
If it turns out to be anywhere near as good as CFinNC was (and I'm sure it will), it will be a conference that you won't want to miss.</p>
