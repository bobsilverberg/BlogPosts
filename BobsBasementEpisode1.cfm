Bob's Basement - Episode 1 - The Good, the Bad and the Awesome

Well, my debut on <a href="http://codebass.net/codebass-radio/" target="_blank">CodeBass Radio</a> has come and gone, so I'd like to post a summary for posterity.
You remember hanging out in your friend's basement? You'd go down there after school, and on the weekends, and you'd chill out and listen to tunes. 
You'd have your favourites that you'd listen to, but as often as not someone would pull out a new record for everyone to check out. 
Maybe it was something they'd just picked up at the local record store, or maybe something from their collection that hadn't seen the stylus in awhile.
Everyone would sit back on the old sectional, the needle would hit the vinyl and you'd be transported somewhere else.</p>
<p>You'd close your eyes and listen as the sound waves did their thing to you.
Sometimes they'd delight, sometimes they'd annoy, and every now and then they'd turn you onto a new band or disc that would stay with you for years to come. Often for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>I remember those days, and I'm going to do my part to bring a touch of that back. 
Join me on Monday, March 7th at <a href="http://bit.ly/hHb5ha" target="_blank">1:00pm Eastern time</a>, on <a href="http://codebass.net/codebass-radio/" target="_blank">CodeBass Radio</a> for the inaugural trip down those stairs and allow me to spin some tunes for you.
Some may be familiar to you, a lot will not be. I hope that you'll enjoy them, and maybe discover some new stuff that you wouldn't have otherwise.</p>
<p>A big thanks goes out to <a href="http://codebass.net/" target="_blank">Vicky Ryder</a> for providing me with this opportunity.
