Presenting Getting Started with ColdFusion 9's ORM Integration to the Online ColdFusion Meetup

Just a quick note to announce that I'm going to be presenting my session, <em>Getting Started with ColdFusion 9's ORM Integration</em> from the <a href="http://www.cfinnc.com/" target="_blank">CFinNC Conference</a> to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/" target="_blank">Online ColdFusion Meetup</a> next Thursday, November 19th, at 6:00pm EDT.
Details can be found at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/calendar/11862981/" target="_blank">Meetup site</a>.
You can <a href="http://experts.acrobat.com/cfmeetup/" target="_blank">attend the presentation via Connect</a> on Thursday, but if you can't make it the session will also be <a href="http://recordings.coldfusionmeetup.com/" target="_blank">recorded and made available</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a description of the session:</p>
<p>We've all heard the buzz about CF9's ORM integration, but exactly what is it, and how can I use it? This session will demystify the idea of ORM by introducing the concepts that you need to know to get started using it right away. Not an object oriented developer? No problem! As long as you know what an object is, and a little bit about cfcs, this session will help you get past the buzzwords and be productive with ORM on your next project.</p>
<p>Hope to see some of you there.</p>
