I'll Be Presenting at NCDevcon in October

I'm tickled pink to announce that I will be presenting a couple of sessions at the upcoming <a href="http://ncdevcon.com/" target="_blank">NCDevCon</a>,
dubbed <em>North Carolina's Premier Web Conference</em>,
which is being held in beautiful Raleigh, North Carolina on May 22nd and 23rd. 
As I discussed in a <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2010/3/13/CFinNC-is-Dead-Long-Live-NCDevCon">previous post</a> 
NCDevCon is being organized by the <a href="http://tacfug.org/" target="_blank">Triangle Area ColdFusion User's Group</a>
and is a sequel to the hugely successful and wildly talked about <a href="http://www.cfinnc.com/" target="_blank">CFinNC</a>.</p>
<p>I will be presenting two sessions:
<ul>
	<li>Getting Started with ColdFusion ORM</li>
	<li>Creating a Twitter / Google Maps Mashup with CF and Open Source Tools</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The first session is one that I have presented before, but ColdFusion ORM is an important topic and therefore the committee considered it worth presenting again.
The second session will be a fun one. In it I will demonstrate how I used a number of freely available open source tools to generate a Google Map
showing the locations of all of my Twitter friends.  This is a project that I built some time ago, and is currently available 
<a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/cfTwitMap/" target="_blank">via my site</a>. I'll be making some updates to it prior to the conference
and my hope is that the session will illustrate two points:
<ol>
	<li>There are pre-existing ColdFusion open source projects that can be used to fulfill many of your application's requirements.</li>
	<li>It's very easy to create something cool using ColdFusion.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>The conference itself is still chock full of ColdFusion, Flex and AIR goodness, but also includes a healthy dose of JavaScript, CSS and other web
development topics. The <a href="http://ncdevcon.com/page.cfm/schedule" target="_blank">schedule with a full list of sessions</a> has been published, 
and it's top notch. I'm particularly pleased to see some folks whom I met last year presenting this year, 
including <a href="http://www.cfgothchic.com/blog/" target="_blank">Daria Norris</a> and <a href="http://www.jimleether.com/" target="_blank">Jim Leether</a>. 
There will also be a number of hands-on ColdFusion sessions for beginners, so if you know someone who would benefit from a bit of a 
ColdFusion kick-start, send them down North Carolina way.</p>
<p><a href="http://ncdevcon2010.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">Registration</a> is open, and, just like last year's CFinNC, it's absolutely free.
I hope to see many of you there.</p>
