Presenting Getting Started with ColdFusion 9's ORM Integration to the Online ColdFusion Meetup

Just a quick note to announce that I'm going to be presenting my session from <a href="http://cfinnc.com/" target="_blank">CFinNC</a> to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/" target="_blank">Online ColdFusion Meetup</a> on Thursday, November 19th, at 6:00pm EDT.</p>
<p>Details can be found at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/calendar/10466208/" target="_blank">Meetup site</a>. You can <a href="http://experts.acrobat.com/cfmeetup/" target="_blank">attend the presentation via Connect</a> on Thursday. The session will be <a href="http://recordings.coldfusionmeetup.com/" target="_blank">recorded and made available</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the description of the presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've all heard the buzz about CF9 ORM integration, but exactly what is it, and how can I use it? This session will demystify the idea of ORM by introducing the concepts that you need to know to get started using it right away. Not an object oriented developer? No problem! As long as you know what an object is, and a little bit about cfcs, this session will help you get past the buzzwords and be productive with Hibernate on your next project. Use Hibernate currently, but not CF? Great! Come and see how the ColdFusion engineering team have made it super simple to use Hibernate, without losing any of the flexibility you're accustomed to.</p>

<p>Hope to see some of you there.</p>
