Sign Up for ColdFusion ORM Training and Get a Copy of the "Hibernate Bible"

<a href="http://www.compoundtheory.com/" target="_blank">Mark Mandel</a>, and I have decided that we're going to give a copy of the book
<em><a href="http://www.manning.com/bauer2/" target="_blank">Java Persistence with Hibernate</a></em> to each and every student at our 
<a href="http://www.ColdFusionORMTraining.com"><em>Developing Applications with ColdFusion 9 Object Relational Mapping</em></a>
workshop, which is running from May 20-21, 2010 in Minneapolis, MN, which also happens to be the two days
immediately preceding the <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective()</a> conference.</p>
<p>I've discussed this two-day, hands-on workshop at length in a previous blog post, so I won't repeat myself here, but one of the goals
of the course is to teach you what you need to know about Hibernate to be effective with ColdFusion 9's ORM features. Although the Adobe 
engineering team have done an excellent job of integrating Hibernate into ColdFusion, it is still essential to understand quite a bit
about Hibernate to make appropriate use of the features. Hibernate is a complex beast, and although we'll be teaching most of what you'll 
need to know in the course, it's always helpful to have a reference manual handy.</p>
<p>There is a lot about Hibernate that is not covered in
the ColdFusion documentation, and Mark and I both feel that <em>Java Persistence with Hibernate</em> is the best book 
currently available on the market about Hibernate. We want to arm our students with the tools they'll need to continue their
ORM education after the workshop, which is why we've decided to give a copy of the book to each student.</p>
<p>There are still spaces available in the class, so if you'd like to become a ColdFusion ORM ninja in just two days, and get a free copy
of the "Hibernate Bible" as well,
