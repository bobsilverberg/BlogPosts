The This Week in ColdFusion Podcast is Back!

That's right, the <a href="http://www.mikechandler.com/" target="_blank">mighty</a>
<a href="http://cfcommons.org/index.cfm/blog" target="_blank">fine</a> <a href="http://mickydionisio.blogspot.com" target="_blank">folks</a>
 who bring you the <em><a href="http://www.twicf.com/" target="_blank">This Week in ColdFusion</a></em> podcast have released a new episode. 
After what seems like an interminable hiatus, the boys are back and guess what? I'm on it too!  I was interviewed about the upcoming
<a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective()</a> conference 
and the incredible <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/index.cfm/pre-conf/" target="_blank">pre-conference training</a>
that will be available. I also discussed 
the <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2009/12/18/Anyone-Can-Speak-at-cfObjective-for-around-six-minutes">Pecha Kucha BOF</a>
that I am organizing.</p>
<p>After my cameo <a href="http://twitter.com/cfcommons" target="_blank">Brian</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/mchandler" target="_blank">Mike</a> had a lively and informative chat about design patterns,
which I stuck my nose into from time to time. 
It was great fun and I encourage you to give it a listen. It's available via iTunes, and can also be listened to or downloaded directly from the 
<a href="http://www.twicf.com/2010/03/twicf-06-introducing-design-patterns/" target="_blank">show page</a>.
