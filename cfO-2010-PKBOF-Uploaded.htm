View the Presentations from the cf.Objective() Pecha Kucha BOF

If you weren't one of the lucky ones who were able to attend the <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective()</a> Pecha Kucha
BOF in April of this year, you can still have a chance to see these nine fantastic presentations. The event turned out to be just as fun and interesting
as I had hoped, which is entirely thanks to the hard work of the presenters. Fortunately 
<a href="http://twitter.com/mcanonigo" target="_blank">Michael Canonigo</a> recorded all but one of the presentations, and  
<a href="http://twitter.com/anthony_id" target="_blank">Anthony Israel-Davis</a> managed to somehow magically record his own, so they are all
available for viewing via YouTube.</p>
<p>I've created a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=058A5D4E2B4C4652" target="_blank">YouTube playlist</a> that you can watch to see the intro 
followed by all nine of the presentations, or, if you want to check them out 
one at a time they are each linked the the respective speaker below.

<p>Thanks again to all of the speakers and all who attended. Hopefully this can become a regular event at cf.Objective() and even possibly at other
conferences.</p>
