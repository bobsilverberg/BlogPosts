We are pleased to announce that our brand new IRC bot,
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/webqabot">webqabot</a>, has joined our
<a href="http://widget01.mibbit.com/?settings=1b10107157e79b08f2bf99a11f521973&server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23mozwebqa">IRC channel</a>.

webqabot is very similar to mozwebqabot, who used to inhabit the channel,
except it is built upon <a href="https://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a>.
It does most of what mozwebqabot did, and also has a nifty new feature
which allows it to announce activity in any of our GitHub repositories.
You may therefore notice a small increase in messages from the bot in the channel
whenever GitHub issues and pull requests are opened and closed, as well as when
code is committed.

There are a few issues open for webqabot, so if you're interested in helping out,
and getting some experience with node.js and CoffeeScript,
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/webqabot/issues">check them out</a>.
You can find more details on webqabot in its
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/webqabot/blob/master/README.md">README file</a>.
