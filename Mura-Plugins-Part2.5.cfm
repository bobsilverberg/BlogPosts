Extending Mura CMS with Plugins - The Story Continues

Just a quick note to say that my languishing series on Extending <a href="http://www.getmura.com/" target="_blank">Mura CMS</a> (an open source ColdFusion CMS) with Plugins
will in fact continue in the very near future.  I took some downtime over the holidays to draft a couple of posts, and I just have to get them ready for publication.  
In an interesting coincidence I discovered, after writing the posts, that the crew at <a href="http://www.blueriver.com/go/br/" target="_blank">Blue River</a>
 have been hosting a webcast, <a href="http://www.getmura.com/index.cfm/support/mura-show/" target="_blank">The Mura Show</a>,
 about Mura, and have been talking about
developing plugins as well.  And then I saw a tweet that mentioned my earlier posts, which pointed me to the <a href="http://coldfusionthrowdown.com/" target="_blank">ColdFusion Throwdown</a>,
 which is hosting a <a href="http://coldfusionthrowdown.com/index.cfm/throwdowns/mura-plugin-throwdown/" target="_blank">competition for developing Mura plugins</a>. 
 So there seems to be a lot of interest in Mura plugins right now.</p>
<p>I watched the first episode of The Mura Show, and it pretty much covered all that I had written, and then some, so I considered not publishing the posts after all.
But I figure that having them as a permanent, readable resource would be of value to some, so I'm going to finish them up and get them out there.  
I hope to then write another post discussing all of the new stuff that I learned from The Mura Show.</p>
<p>So stay tuned for some more Mura goodness!</p>
