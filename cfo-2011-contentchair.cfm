cf.Objective() 2011 - The Wheels are in Motion

Although it's still 2010, we are already hard at work creating a <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective()</a> for 2011 
which I'm confident will be the best ever. Why am I so confident? As <a href="http://corfield.org/" target="_blank">Sean Corfield</a> recently <a href="http://corfield.org/blog/post.cfm/cf-objective-passing-the-torch" target="_blank">announced on his blog</a>, 
I have the honour of taking on the role of Content Chair 
for next year's conference and I've formed a Content Advisory Board (CAB) with some of the best, and most innovative, minds in the CF community. They are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.barneyb.com/barneyblog/" target="_blank">Barney Boisvert</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.nodans.com/" target="_blank">Dan Wilson</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/egchristiansen" target="_blank">Emily Christiansen</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.12robots.com/" target="_blank">Jason Dean</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.wiersmablog.com/machblog/" target="_blank">Kurt Wiersma</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.mxunit.org/" target="_blank">Marc Esher</a></li>
</ul></p>
<p>We're going to do our darnedest to bring you the content you want, from the top names in the CF community and also from some really
smart folks with whose names you may not be familiar.</p>
<h3>Topic Suggestion Survey</h3>
<p>One of the first things we want to do is ask you, the community, just what it is you'd like to learn about at next year's conference.
To that end we've put together a <a href="http://engage.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">simple survey</a> which will give you the opportunity to suggest topics of interest to you, and
to vote on topics suggested by others. The results of this survey will be just one of many forms of input that we'll be using 
to determine which topics to feature at next year's conference, so while it will not be determining the full list of sessions, we are
very keen to hear from you about what you'd like to see. So go <a href="http://engage.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">suggest a topic or vote on some</a> now.</p>
<p>A big thank you goes out to <a href="http://blog.mattwoodward.com/" target="_blank">Matt Woodward</a> for the app that we're using to collect topic suggestions.</p>
<h3>New Content</h3>
<p>Of course every year cf.Objective() is chock full of new content, but we're going to be looking at zeroing in on some new areas in 2011.
Some examples include:
<ul>
	<li><em>Front-End Development</em> - In addition to the usual Flex, AIR and Ajax talks look for talks on advanced JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, and, of course, Mobile Development.</li>
	<li><em>Deep Dives</em> - These talks will go deep into one specific aspect of a technology or technique, designed to teach you something new about a familiar topic.</li>
	<li><em>Pushing the Envelope</em> - These mind-expanding talks will introduce you to ideas and technologies that many CF developers have never been exposed to.</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>Pecha Kucha and Lightning Talks</h3>
<p>Those who were lucky enough to attend last year's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha" target="_blank">Pecha Kucha</a> 
will tell you it was an awesome experience; both educational and entertaining.
This year we'll be holding an official Pecha Kucha which will not be running opposite any BoFs, so the whole community can come together
and cheer on our brave PKers.</p>
<p>We're also planning on having a series of lightning talks, which will also be limited to six minutes and forty seconds apiece,
but won't have the strict rule of 20 slides for 20 seconds. This will allow people to do code talks and demos of interesting technologies and
solutions. We'll be looking to you, the community, to present at both of these sessions. Stay tuned for more info on how to propose a talk.</p>
<h3>Just the Beginning</h3>
<p>We're only just getting started, so now is the ideal time to have your voice heard.  Visit the <a href="http://engage.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">Topic Suggestion Survey</a>,
leave a comment below, or feel free to contact me personally with any ideas or suggestions that you have. 
Next year's cf.Objective() is going to be the best not because of us, but because of you!</p>
