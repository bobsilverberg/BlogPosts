Actual Documentation Available for ValidateThis

I've been working on ValidateThis, my validation framework for ColdFusion objects, for several months now, and it has evolved to a point that I'm actually quite proud of. I understand that there are even some developers other than me using it! So I figured that the next step towards making it usable by others was to come up with some documentation that is a bit more organized than the ramblings in my blog posts.</p>
<p>So I'm pleased as punch to announce that the official documentation for ValidateThis is now available online! Just cruise on over to <a href="http://www.validatethis.org/docs/">www.validatethis.org/docs/</a> and take a gander. There are still a number of sections that have yet to be updated, but I think that I've captured the core information that most users will need.</p>
<p>It was a lot more work that I anticipated, and I am grateful to <a href="http://www.luismajano.com" target="_blank">Luis Majano</a> and <a href="http://www.compoundtheory.com" target="_blank">Mark Mandel</a> for developing the excellent <a href="http://codexwiki.org" target="_blank">CodexWiki</a> which is behind the content.</p>
<p>If anyone reading this has any comments, corrections or questions about the docs, please feel free to leave a comment here.</p>
<p>Whew!</p>
