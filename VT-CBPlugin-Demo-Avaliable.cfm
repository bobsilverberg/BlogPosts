ValidateThis! Coldbox Plugin Demo Now Available Online

I mentioned in my <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2009/7/23/A-Coldbox-Plugin-for-ValidateThis-is-Now-Available">last post</a> that I created a demo which uses the new ValidateThis! Coldbox plugin to integrate VT with CB.
 That demo is now available online at <a href="http://www.validatethis.org/TransferSample_ValidateThis/index.cfm">www.validatethis.org/TransferSample_ValidateThis/index.cfm</a>.
</p>
<p>Note that only the Edit User page has been updated to make use of VT.</p>
<p>Also, if you're looking for a copy of the Coldbox Plugin it is available in the /extras folder of the framework download, which can be found at the <a href="http://validatethis.riaforge.org/">Riaforge site</a>. I'm also attaching just the plugin file to this blog post.</p>
