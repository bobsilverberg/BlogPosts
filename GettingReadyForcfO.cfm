Using ColdFusion to Create a Twitter/Google Maps Mashup

I thought it would be interesting to see a map of where all of my Twitter friends and followers are, and knowing that both Twitter and Google Maps provide APIs I figured I could throw something together pretty easily. I was correct.

<p>I made use of a number of Open Source libraries including <a href="http://blog.pcsilva.com/" target="_blank">Pedro Claudio's</a> <a href="http://cftwitterlib.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">ColdFusion Twitter Lib, <a href="http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/" target="_blank">Ray Camden's</a> <a href="http://googlegeocode.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">Google Geocode</a>, and  'I'm also keen to hear any recommendations from anyone familiar with Minneapolis on good places to shop/sightsee/eat.</p>
<p>I'll be using Twitter between now and the end of the conference, after which I imagine I'll be giving it up for good. If you like you can follow me (I tend to be pretty quiet) <a href="http://twitter.com/elegant_chaos" target="_blank">@elegant_chaos</a>. I hope to see lots of you there!</p>
