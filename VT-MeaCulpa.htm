ValidateThis! - Mea Culpa

While working on a very cool update to my <a href="http://validatethis.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">object oriented validation framework</a> for ColdFusion I discovered that my last update introduced an error.  This error caused the <a href="http://www.validatethis.org/" target="_blank">online demo</a> to not report certain server side validation failures and also had repercussions for the <em>required</em> server side validation type.</p>
<p>So, if you visited the demo page and thought, "What's up with this guy?  This thing doesn't work at all!", or if you've downloaded the code from RIAForge recently, you may want to check out the demo and/or redownload.  The problem has been fixed in both locations.</p>
<p>Note to self - more unit tests are needed!</p>
<p>P.S.  I hope to blog about the cool new changes in the very near future.</p>
