Testing Application and Session Integration with FW/1

<a href="http://corfield.org/" target="_blank">Sean Corfield</a> recently <a href="http://fw1.riaforge.org/blog/index.cfm/2009/7/19/Introducing-Framework-One" target="_blank">released</a> a very lightweight MVC application framework called <a href="http://fw1.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">Framework One</a> (FW/1 for short).  I've been doing quite a bit of development of plugins for <a href="http://www.getmura.com/" target="_blank">Mura CMS</a> lately and I've been looking for a lightweight front-controller, so it sounded like a potentially good match.</p>
<p>I've been working with <a href="http://patweb99.avatu.com/" target="_blank">Pat Santora</a> of <a href="http://www.blueriver.com/go/br/" target="_blank">Blue River</a> on a Mura CMS plugin that will enable a developer to plug a FW/1 application into Mura.  One of the things we needed to do was to ensure that FW/1's events were properly tied in to Mura's events.  To that end I created a little test application that makes use of FW/1's setupApplication() and setupSession() methods.</p>
<p>I thought that this sample app might be useful to someone else who is attempting a different form of integration, so I'm attaching it to this post.</p>
