Join me at RIA Unleashed in Boston to Learn about ColdFusion ORM

I am pleased and honoured to announce that I'll be teaching and speaking at <a href="http://www.riaunleashed.com/" target="_blank">RIA Unleashed</a> in Boston in November.
Organized by <a href="http://www.remotesynthesis.com/" target="_blank">Brian Rinaldi</a> (one of my heroes in the ColdFusion community), RIA Unleashed is a conference that I have wanted to attend in the past and I think this year's
version is going to be stellar. The format is a bit different from other CF conferences that I have attended: it's a two day conference, with day one consisting of
half-day hands-on workshops, and day two having standard one-hour sessions across multiple tracks. You can find more information about the 
<a href="http://www.riaunleashed.com/page.cfm/workshops" target="_blank">half-day workshops</a> 
and <a href="http://www.riaunleashed.com/page.cfm/topics" target="_blank">one-hour sessions</a> at
the RIA Unleashed site.</p>

<p>The conference runs from November 11-12, 2010, in Boston. You can register for just day one for $150, just day two for $50, or both days for the bargain price of $175,
which includes lunch on both days and a party on Thursday night.
Brian is also running a <a href="http://www.remotesynthesis.com/post.cfm/win-a-free-2-day-pass-to-ria-unleashed-2010" target="_blank">contest</a> which will award 
three lucky winners with a two-day pass to the conference.</p>
<p>I'll be teaching a half-day workshop and presenting a session on, you guessed it, ColdFusion ORM. The day one workshop will be a hands-on introduction to ColdFusion ORM,
designed to teach you the basics of working with this powerful new technology. My session on day two is called "What Your Mother Never Told You About ColdFusion ORM",
and it covers advanced topics that you won't read about in the ColdFusion documentation. It will be a great follow up for folks who attend the half-day ORM workshop, and
will also be valuable to anyone who's looked at ColdFusion ORM already.</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to attending this conference, and I hope to see some of you there in November.</p>
