Paul Marcotte on Transient Factories

Just a note to say that <a href="http://www.fancybread.com/blog/" target="_blank">Paul Marcotte</a> has written an interesting <a href="http://www.fancybread.com/blog/index.cfm/2008/11/7/A-Coldfusion-Transient-Factory-Example" target="_blank">blog post</a> describing a ColdFusion component which is an implementation of a Factory Pattern.  This component can be used to centralize creation of transient objects in your model.  He has included a description of the usage of the component that he wrote (with a tiny bit of input from me), as well as a download of that component.  I am using this Transient Factory inside my own validation framework and have found it to be very useful.</p>
<p>I believe the component will also be available on <a href="http://www.riaforge.org/" target="_blank">RIAForge</a> in the not too distant future.</p>
