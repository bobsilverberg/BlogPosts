I'll Be Presenting at cf.Objective() in April

<p>I am pleased and honoured to announce that I'll be presenting at <a href="http://www.cfobjective.com/" target="_blank">cf.Objective()</a>, billed as the Only Enterprise ColdFusion Conference, which runs from April 22-24 in Minneapolis, MN.
It's going to be quite the experience for me. Not only am I speaking on two topics (details to follow in a separate post):
<ul>
	<li>Easy and Flexible Validations for Objects</li>
	<li>What Your Mother Never Told You About CF9 ORM</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I'm also organizing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha" target="_blank">Pecha Kucha</a> Birds of a Feather session (BoF),
during which people will be giving mini-presentations in which they show <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-09/st_pechakucha" target="_blank">20 slides for 20 seconds each</a>. 
I've <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2009/12/18/Anyone-Can-Speak-at-cfObjective-for-around-six-minutes">written about this BoF on my blog previously</a>,
but I'll mention again that anyone interested in presenting should leave me a comment on my blog or email me directly at bob dot silverberg at gmail dot com.</p>
<p>As if that's not enough, <a href="http://www.compoundtheory.com/" target="_blank">Mark Mandel</a> and I will be delivering a comprehensive hands-on two-day pre-conference workshop
on Developing Applications with ColdFusion 9 Object Relational Mapping. A separate post with the details of that workshop will follow, but in a nutshell it is designed to give you all
of the information you need to get up and running with ColdFusion 9's ORM features in your next project.  You'll write a ton of code, learning the basics as well as best practices
and things to watch out for. I think it's going to be a lot of fun (in addition to a great learning experience).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bestmeetings.com/registration/cfobjective/cfobjective.cfm" target="_blank">Registration is now open</a>,
both for the conference and for the CF9 ORM workshop (you can sign up for it during the conference registration). There is a discounted rate for both the conference and the training
available until January 29th, so you might want to register sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>I hope to see many of you there in April.</p>
