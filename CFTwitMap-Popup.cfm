Adding Statuses to the ColdFusion Twitter/Google Maps Mashup

I just enhanced my <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/CFTwitMap/CFTwitMap.cfm" target="_blank">ColdFusion driven Twitter/Google Maps Mashup</a> using the PopupMarker library from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-utility-library/" target="_blank">Google Maps API Utility Library</a>.  Now when you zoom in close enough to see single markers, not only will you see their screen names on hover, but you'll also see their latest status update in a popup balloon.</p>
<p>As always, the latest code is attached to this post.</p>
