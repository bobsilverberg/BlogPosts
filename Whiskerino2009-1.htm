OT: My First Whiskerino

Well, I've gone and done it. I managed to register for <a href="http://whiskerino.org/2009/" target="_blank">Whiskerino</a> this year, and I've shaved off the couple of weeks of growth that I've carried around for several years. Thanks to <a href="http://www.andymatthews.net/" target="_blank">Andy Matthews</a>, aka <a href="http://whiskerino.org/2009/beards/creole/" target="_blank">creole</a>, for turning me on to this beardfest, and for the advice that I should try to register early. My wife isn't thrilled about the whole thing, but I figure if she can have fun putting on makeup and jewelery and fancy dresses every now and then then I should be allowed to <a href="http://whiskerino.org/2009/beards/elegantchaos/" target="_blank">have some fun with my appearance</a> for a change.</p>
<p>There will no doubt be another blog post or two about this over the next four months, but for now, for posterity, I leave the interwebs with before and after pictures from today, as well as a video of me starting the endeavour.
