Getting Started with ColdFusion 9 ORM Integration - Slides Available

The slides, which include all of the sample code from my <a href="http://cfinnc.com/" target="_blank">CFinNC</a> presentation, <em>Getting Started with ColdFusion 9 ORM Integration</em>, are now available. Click on the link below to download them. I developed these slides using Keynote, and attempted to save them as a PowerPoint presentation, but ended up with slides that looked like crap, so I saved them as a PDF for the download. The slides look good, but the file is <strong>big</strong>. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in having me deliver this presentation to a ColdFusion User Group via connect please feel free to leave me a comment, or send me an email.</p>

<p>Here is the description of the presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've all heard the buzz about CF9 ORM integration, but exactly what is it, and how can I use it? This session will demystify the idea of ORM by introducing the concepts that you need to know to get started using it right away. Not an object oriented developer? No problem! As long as you know what an object is, and a little bit about cfcs, this session will help you get past the buzzwords and be productive with Hibernate on your next project. Use Hibernate currently, but not CF? Great! Come and see how the ColdFusion engineering team have made it super simple to use Hibernate, without losing any of the flexibility you're accustomed to.</p>
