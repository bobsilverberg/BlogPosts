Chrome to Notifo Extension Sends iPhone Notifications of Links from your Browser

As you may have gleaned from my last web post on the topic, I've been playing with the <a href="http://notifo.com/" target="_blank">Notifo</a> mobile
notification service lately. One tool that Notifo co-founder <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/" target="_blank">Paul Stamatiou</a> has created is a Google
Chrome extension that lets you send a notification with a link to a web page right from within your browser.</p>
<p>Just install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/lgffhepmapgeepjnhchaabmaoijfcnhi" target="_blank">Chrome to Notifo Extension</a>, 
configure it with your Notifo Username and APISecret, and then, with the click of a button, you can send a notification of any web page that you're browsing
to your phone. When you open the notification in Notifo, its internal browser will take you right to the site. 
It's not that big a deal, but I still think it's pretty cool.
I'm looking forward to seeing what other neat stuff the folks at Notifo come up with.</p>
