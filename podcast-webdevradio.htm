My Interview on WebDevRadio

I had the honour and pleasure of being interviewed by <a href="http://michaelkimsal.com/blog/" target="_blank">Michael Kimsal</a> for his 
<a href="http://webdevradio.com/" target="_blank">WebDevRadio podcast</a> a few weeks ago. 
The episode was published last week and is now available for listening and/or downloading from 
the <a href="http://webdevradio.com/index.php?id=103" target="_blank">podcast website</a>, as well as 
via <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/webdevradio-com-web-development/id74402299" target="_blank">iTunes</a>.</p> 
<p>For those of you that don't know Michael, you're missing out. I met him at NCDevCon and found him to be an extremely pleasant, funny and smart individual.
I enjoyed my chats with him at the conference, and really enjoyed discussing all sorts of topics with him for the podcast, including, 
but not limited to, how I came to develop using ColdFusion, contributing to open source projects, test-driven development and unit testing in general, and
object-relational mapping (ORM) in ColdFusion. I also really appreciated the opportunity to have my voice heard outside of the ColdFusion community.</p>
