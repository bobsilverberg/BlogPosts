Easy to Follow OO Design Posts? - Follow Me

I wanted to thank <a href="http://www.aliaspooryorik.com/blog/" target="_blank">John Whish</a> for his recent <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/index.cfm?dax=blog:1377.view#comments">comment</a> on <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/recent-blog-entries.htm" target="_blank">Ben Nadel</a>'s blog directing interested parties to the <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/OO-Design">OO Design</a> category on my blog for:
<blockquote><p>some good stuff at a higher level which is fairly easy to follow</p></blockquote>
<p>I endeavour to write material that is accessible and I'm always very happy to hear that others are finding value in what I write.  I like to think that much of what I've written falls into the "easy to follow" category, particularly the <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/How-I-Use-Transfer"><em>How I Use Transfer</em></a> series, so I might suggest that anyone looking for "easy to follow" could do well to start with that set of posts.  I certainly don't want to discourage anyone from delving into the <a href="http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/ValidateThis">ValidateThis!</a> series as well, but I fear it may be a bit more difficult to follow and comprehend than the rest of the posts in the OO Design category, and I wouldn't want to scare anyone off.</p>
<p>Thanks again, John, for the kind words and the link.</p>
